<p>This online infrastructure allows students to easily read, complete, and run C++-based lessons through the course website. The framework generates interactive web pages from doxygen-like lesson source files. It also records student submissions for instructor grading. The server includes a mechanism to compile C++ code into WebAssembly, allowing users to execute simple C++ programs directly in the browser. This website is implemented with Django and deployed with Apache, SSL certification, and single-service sign on through Carnegie Mellon University using Shibboleth.</p>
<p>I was the sole developer of this project, so I was entirely responsible for designing, implementing, and deploying the framework according to specifications provided by Jim McCann, professor of Computer Game Programming.</p>
